# Persistence

Persistence is as you'd expect -- just provide a file name when opening the database.

An example for browser environments is below.

<Callout type="info">
The example below is runnable. You can make changes to the code and re-run it by pressing `shift + enter`.
</Callout>

Import the required packages and init the wasm:

<RunnableCode
  code={`const initWasm = await import('https://esm.sh/@vlcn.io/crsqlite-wasm@0.9.1')
const sqlite = await initWasm.default(() => "https://esm.sh/@vlcn.io/crsqlite-wasm@0.9.1/dist/crsqlite.wasm");
provide sqlite;`}
/>

Now create a database. To make it persisted all you need to do is pass in a filename. Omitting the filename runs the database in memory.

<RunnableCode
  code={`use sqlite;
const db = await sqlite.open("guide-persistence");
window.onbeforeunload = () => {
  return db.close();
};
await db.exec(
\`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todo (id primary key, "text", completed)\`
);
provide db;`}
/>

And finally, write then read some data to check it out:

<RunnableCode
  code={`use db;
const items = ['Milk', 'Bread', 'Peas', 'Carrots', 'Lentils', 'Cake', 'Squirrels'];
await db.exec(
  \`INSERT INTO todo (id, "text", completed) VALUES (
    '\${nanoid()}',
    'Buy \${items[(Math.random() * items.length) | 0]}',
    0
  )\`);
return await db.execO(\`SELECT * FROM todo\`);
`}
/>

To check that it did indeed persist, refresh this page a few times and see the number of todos grow!
