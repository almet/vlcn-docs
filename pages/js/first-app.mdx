# Your First App

Scaffolding your first app:

With NPM:

```bash
npm create @vlcn.io your-app-name
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn create @vlcn.io your-app-name
```

With PNPM:

```bash
pnpm create @vlcn.io your-app-name
```

Once your project has been scaffolded, you can run it with:

```bash
cd your-app-name
npm install # or yarn or pnpm
npm run dev
```

The scaffolding will set you up with:

1. A SPA that loads up a SQLite DB
2. A Schema file that defines your data model and is automatically applied to your DBs
3. A sync server that will sync your DBs with other devices

The scaffolding will create an app that looks like this: https://vite-starter.fly.dev/
