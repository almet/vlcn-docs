# Reactivity

Reactivity, not to be confused with React, is the ability to observe the database for changes so you have the opportunity to react to those changes.

This is available through the `rx-tbl` package which will eventually be replaced by the `rx-query` package.

The difference is that `rx-tbl` lets you listen for changes at a table level where as `rx-query` will let you listen for changes at a query level.
