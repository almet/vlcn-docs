# Table CRDTs

The type of CRDT chosen for a table controls what rows are included or excluded when merging tables together from different databases.

There are a few basic strategieis:

- Tables can only Grow (Grow Only Set)
- Tables can grow and shrink, but once a row is deleted it cannot be re-inserted (Delete Wins Set)
- Tables can grow and shrink, deleted rows can be re-inserted and re-deleted (Causal Length Set)

By default all `crrs` are currently modeled as causal length sets. In other words, deleted rows can later be re-inserted if desired.
