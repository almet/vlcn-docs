# Table CRDTs

The type of CRDT chosen for a table controls what rows are included or excluded when merging tables together from different databases.

There are a few basic strategieis:

- Tables can only Grow (Grow Only Set)
- Tables can grow and shrink, but once a row is deleted it cannot be re-inserted (Delete Wins Set)
- Tables can grow and shrink, deleted rows can be re-inserted and re-deleted (Causal Length Set)

By default all `crrs` are currently modeled as delete wins sets. A future version of `cr-sqlite` will model all `crrs`` as causal length sets instead. The reason being that is the most generic form upon which any other type can be built in user space.

Today you can implement causal length in user space by using "soft deletion".

1. Add an `is_deleted` column to your table
2. When you delete a row set `is_deleted` to `true`
3. When you re-insert a row set `is_deleted` to `false`

Obviously the drawback here is that your reads would need to manually filter out deleted rows.

If you want grow only semantics, install a trigger on your `crr` that prevents deletes. That or don't issue a delete against the table.
