# Custom Syntax

A current eye-sore of CR-SQLite is the use of `SELECT` statements to invoke functions which does some sort of modification of the database schema. Another eye-sore is the requirement to wrap alterations of `crr`s with `crsql_begin/commit_alter`.

Luckily, we're partnering with the folks over at the [libsql](https://libsql.org/) project to add a dedicated syntax for CRR creation and modification.

```sql
CREATE CLSet post (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 views COUNTER,
 content PERITEXT,
 owner_id LWW INTEGER
);
```

The above defines a CRR where:

- The table is a CLSet ([causal length set](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3380787.3393678))
- Views is a COUNTER ([distributed counter](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/cs380p/papers/Counters.html))
- Content is PERITEXT ([collaborative text](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/))
- owner_id is a LWW register
