# crsql_finalize

Tears down the extension. Should be run on any connection that has loaded `cr-sqlite` in order to free all resources before closing the connection.

<Callout type="info">
Why can't `crsqlite` auto-destruct itself? See this issue in SQLite:  https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/c94f943821

```sql
SELECT crsql_finalize();
```
