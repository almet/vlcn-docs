# Migrations

Tables that have been upgraded to `crr`s need some extra handling during schema modification. This is because bookkeeping metadata needs to be migrated as well.

When modifying the schema of a `crr`:

1. Be sure you start that modification with a call to `crsql_begin_alter`
2. Complete that modification with a call to `crsql_commit_alter`

calls to [`crsql_begin_alter`](./api-methods/crsql_begin_alter) and [`crsql_commit_alter`](./api-methods/crsql_commit_alter) may be nested as well as occur in an outer transaction.

If the alter fails, all levels of transactions and savepoints will be rolled back.

## Usage

```sql
SELECT crsql_begin_alter('table_name');
...
SELECT crsql_commit_alter('table_name');
```

## Example

```sql
SELECT crsql_begin_alter('foo');
ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN c TEXT;
SELECT crsql_commit_alter('foo');
SELECT crsql_begin_alter('bar');
ALTER TABLE bar ADD COLUMN baz TEXT;
SELECT crsql_commit_alter('bar');
```

Currently supported schema alterations:

1. add columns
2. drop columns
3. rename columns
4. modifying indices

Support for renaming tables is a work in progress.

## Automatic Migrations

<Callout type="warning">
  Automatic migrations should only be used during development at this time.
</Callout>

Automatic migrations work by diffing the current schema of the database with a desired schema.
Alter table and index statements are automatically generated and applied to the database.

This will be in the v0.10 release and can be accomplished like so:

```sql
SELECT crsql_migrate('contents of your schema file');
```
