# CRDTs - About

cr-sqlite allows merging of databases by using conflit-free replicated data types.

The big idea is that you define a table then say which CRDTs should be used to model it.

```sql
CREATE CLSet post (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 views COUNTER,
 content PERITEXT,
 owner_id LWW INTEGER
);
```

## Table CRDTs

Tables can be thought of as a set of rows where the identity of each row is its primary key. When converting a table to a crr, you can specify the semantics of how that set of rows should be merged.

cr-sqlite supports modeling tables as:

1. Delete Wins Sets
2. Causal Length Sets
3. Grow Only Sets

## Row & Column CRDTs

A row can be thought of as a map. The keys of that map are the column names. The values are the column values for that row.

When defining a table, each column can be assigned a CRDT type. The following CRDTs are supported:

1. Last Write Wins Register
2. Distributed Fractional Index
3. Counter

## Sequence, Tree & Recursive CRDTs
