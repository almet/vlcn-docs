# Constraints

Tables that have been upgraded to `crrs` may not have:

1. Foreign key Constraints
2. Unique constraints that are not the primary key
3. Check constraints

While there are techniques that allow preserving foreign keys, even under conditions created by eventual consistency, they all have nuanced tradeoffs. Throwing out these constraints for `crrs` is something that is clear and keeps the model easy to undestand.
