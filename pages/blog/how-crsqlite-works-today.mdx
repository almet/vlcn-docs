# How CR-SQLite Works Today

cr-sqlite started with a few foundational decisions:

1. Re-use as much of SQLite as possible. No custom trees or VFSs.
2. Have 0 impact on read performance.
3. Writes to CRRs should be no slower than 3x a write to a normal SQLite table.
4. The amount of storage required should be a constant factor of the size of the base data, no matter how long a peer is offline. I.e., if your SQLite DB would be Xmb without CRR support, it should be C*Xmb with CRR support even if a peer is offline indefinitely. Note: there is a caveat here around deletions.
5. Deltas between two databases can be computed by only exchanging Lamport timestamps.

The most influential decision is (4). This means that we _only_ keep current state around. We do not retain the history of modifications that have occurred on the database nor do we keep an event log.

The practical impacts of this are:

1. On syncing transactions.
2. The first CRDT types made available

## Syncing Transactions

Every commit to the database gets a `db_version` associated with it. So this certainly sounds like that when you ask `crsql_changes` for all changes with a given `db_version` it'll return all changes that were made in that commit.

This is true up to a point. Since `cr-sqlite`, in today's form, only retains the current state of the DB this can fail to hold true in the following scenario.



So while you can commit atomic transactions locally, when syncing a transaction _might be_ split up across two db_versions. We're testing different options to resolve this while still keeping a tiny storage footprint which you can read about in [how-crsqlite-works-tomorrow](./how-crsqlite-works-tomorrow).
